2.3.5
- MEL change for Maya 2009
- compatibility fixes for linux
- output of plugin shapes in RIB, so they can be used as placeholders
- working xcodeproj file for MAC, thanks to Brian Sundman

2.3.4
- RIReadArchive Mel command updated, the -inline(i) flag inlines the Read Archive into the RIB
- liquidCleanup command script modified so confirm dialog can be supressed (to use it in scripts)
- wiki link changed in globals
- "Render All Curves" global option fixed, global switch for curve rendering
- the Maya Subdiv render module is fixed, maya subdivs are now ouput properly, with the following limitations:
  - only the base mesh (level 0) is output (no hierarchy edits)
  - level 0 edge/vertex creases are always hard (crease value 7), all other levels are ignored
 - maya subdivs can be tagged like polygons through the liquid menu which gives access to the boundary interpolation options

2.3.3
- liquidGeneratePlace3dTexture( int scoped ) mel command available - maya 3d textures will be output in RIB as scoped or standard coordinate systems
- liquid curves can be assigned a base and tip width
- new liquid curves group creates a single RiCurves primitive for a group of nurbs curves
- new liquid bounding box locator that resizes automatically to its children used for the curves group

2.3.2
- custom shading group integrated in the shading attributes, you can now connect a shading group to any object, like locators etc
- liquidGeneratePlace2dTexture.mel to be used in postWorldMel slot/Render Globals will output all pace2dTexure nodes in RIB (for Prman)
- othreshold and zthreshold as color values in globals
- Paint Effects group integrated in attribute editor, assignment of individual shading groups to tubes, leafs and petals now possible
- fixed a bug in the PRMAN build, the Rib output of the "P" parameter got lost if a rib object got used more than once, i.e. for shadows or motionblur

2.3.1
- adapted to maya2008 uvs for polys and subdivs
- applied patch for Aqsis settings

2.3.0
- added prePosterous group - mel binding for preTransform,
  postTransform, preShape and postShape scripts

- first shadowcam outputs always with "aggregate" set to 0 to overwrite old map if it exists
- fixed naming when using shadow sets
- error message "problem using shader..." fixed
- paint effects exporter extension - shader assignment to paint effects, uniform width, camera facing and curve id implemented
- paint effects menu item to add/remove these attributes to pfx strokes
- added more shadow controls, subd menu updated
- added support for mid-point ratio attribute on a camera
- implementation of inclusive/exclusive light linking similar to "illuminate by default" on/off in maya, in the liquid globals
- liquid rib request node, holds preWorld/preFrame etc. attributes and can be saved with a file, main use for inline archives (instancing)
- liquid light linker - fast alternative to maya light linker
- subdiv tag error corrected causing many error messages
  

1.6.7 (on sourceforge again!)

- Fixed shader preview for Linux platform (untested on OS X!)
- Linux installer script now automatically compiles the Liquid shaders for all
    installed renderers
- Added new global to allow separate control for camera motion blur
- UI improvements for all file browser dialogs (including Fluid's browser)
    thanks to Alexandre Paes
- Fixed a bug that led to attributes not being recorded properly for RIB output
- Fix to Subdivision UI


1.6.6 (not on sourceforge):

- Support for creases/corners/holes on subdivison meshes including a nice
    Subdivision Surface Inspector panel    
- Support for arbitrary renderer configurations in the Liquid Render Globals
- Support for rendering dependent files w/o the need to use a Job Script
    anymore (e.g. shadow passes)
- Several different Liquid plug-ins can now be installed on the same machine
- Added support for certain ray tracing attributes on lights    
- RIB & display filename from the Liquid Render Globals is handled more
    logical now (hopefully):
    - The scene's name is used as the display name if the latter was omitted
    - The display name is never used as the RIB basename
    - The RIB basename is used as the display name if the latter was omitted
    - The scene's name is used as the RIB basename if the latter was omitted    
- Pathnames are now santized everywhere in the RIB
- Fixed a bug that caused motion blur to be switched off randomly
    (Thx for reporting & providing a Maya scene exposing it go to Christopher)


1.6.5 (not on sourceforge):

- New code for correct handling of particle motion blur
- Fixed a bad memory handling bug that led to crashes with the improved
    uv code on subdivs and polygon-/subdivision meshes
- RIB size improvements (smaller RIBs):
    - Liquid now uses RIB inline parameter declarations only
    - Support of 3Delight's more compact "sphere"-type RiPoint particles
- RIB Attribute support through a new 'Attributes' pop-up in the Liquid menu
    and a new 'Liquid' roll-out in Maya's Attribute Editor
- Trace set membership support through a new 'Set Attributes' pop-up in the
    Liquid menu and a new 'Liquid' roll-out for objectSets in Maya's Attribute
    Editor
- Buffed up Maya lights support. Point-, distant- and spotlights now use a
    liquid* variant of the resp. shader. Most Maya light attributes are handled
    as a user would expect (particularly Decay)
- New Liquid global 'Shutter Config'. Allows to choose if the shutter opens on
    frame, is centered on frame, is centered between frames or closes on the
    next frame (do I hear someone bitch about not enough shutter
    configurations? ;>)
- Lights too can now have ray tracing attributes attached through the Light
    menu


1.6.4 (not on sourceforge):

- Added new Liquid global "Output Mesh UVs" to control writing of redundant uv
    data to RIBs
- Fixed uv code for Maya subdivision surfaces
- Switched uv interpolation scheme for 3Delight from "facevarying" to
    "facevertex" -- this should solve all uv warping/interpolation problems on
    subdivison surfaces
- Added default behaviour for undefined shader searchpath and added default
    shader searchpath to the searchpath written to the RIB
    

1.6.3 (not on sourceforge):

- Added new options to and buffed up Liquid's shader preview
- Moved Fluid options to their own tab in the Liquid Render Globals
- Minor bugfixes in Liquid's curve code
- Added code to support curves in 3Delight


1.6.2 (not on sourceforge):

- Liquid now automatically substitutes backslashes on Windows in Fluid's file
    chooser dialog
- New sprite particle support
- Pixie support
- OSX support
- Added new Liquid global to control output of shaders in deep shadow passes
- Fixed initialization and cleanup code to account for more than five motion
    samples


1.6.1-5 (not on sourceforge):

- Deactivated the code in liquidReAttachParams.mel that led to flushing of
    string paramater values on shader reload in Fluid
- Fixed Maya Subdivision Surface code -- Maya subdivs now work, including
    Maya's creasing system. Hardness is ignored, this is a limitation of the
    Maya API. Creased edges and vertices are written with a hardness of 6.0 now
      -- this gives a nice, subtle bevel and ensures that surfaces are still
      tangent continous at creases


1.6.1-4 (not on sourceforge):

- light linking is no longer (erratically) written out in a shadow pass
- lights and light linking can now be written out in a deep shadow pass if the
    "Output Lightsources" in the "Deep Shadow Maps" rollout of the Liquid
    Render Globals is checked
- added full support (and new Liquid global) for relative pathnames;
    RIBs, archives, the job script etc. now all contain relative pathnames if
    this option is switched on
- added command line support for rendering sequences to the dojob.py Python
    script


1.6.1-3 (not on sourceforge):

- Fixed uninitialized string array bug with blobbies; blobbies code activated
    -- blobbies now actually work
- Fixed Motion Samples glitch; now the maximum number of motion samples is 16
- Added quotes to render script filename in win32 build
- Added binary RIB output support for 3Delight
- Added deep shadow support for 3Delight's "dsm" driver
- Changed Opacity to be a color instead of a float


1.6.1-2 (not on sourceforge):

- Fixed __Pref bug with subdiv-/polygon meshes; __Pref was not initialized
    correctly and hence never got written out correctly to the RIB
- Interpolate Boundary on subdivs works now
- Fixed shader preview in Fluid


1.6.1 (not on sourceforge):

- Displacement bounds are now explicitly specified in "shader" space;
    there's no way to currently change this; maybe add another Liquid global?
- Added new Liquid global: compiledShaderExt; can be set to e.g. "sdl" for
    3Delight or "slo" for PRMan
- Liquid now writes out all coordinate systems after the lights but before any
    other stuff in the RIB; previously coordinate systems where written out
    scattered between the other geometry according to the order in the Maya
    Outliner
- If a Maya light has raytraced shadows switched on,
    Attribute "light" "string shadows" [ "on" ]
    is now written to the RIB regardless of BMRT being used or not
- New attribute liqInvisible; works as mtorInvisible -- tagged objects are
    ignored by Liquid


1.6:

- Maya 6.0 build
- Maya OSX build
- XML format render script output
- View last RIB/render-script fixed for win32
- Shadow map (including deep shadows) fixes
- Other stuff


1.5.6 (not on sourceforge):

- Added quotes to all filenames for win32. Now pathnames with spaces will work
    in bloody Windoze
- new Liquid global: preGeom; the contents of this string is written to the RIB
    after lights and coordinate systems, but before geometry
- Liquid now understands the mtorSubdiv attribute
- /Considerably/ buffed up resp. changed the entire MEL interface;
    changed naming to be more MtoR compatible: added separators and ellipses,
    reordered menus where appropriate and added support for file browser
    dialogs to Fluid string input fields
- Removed BMRT tab and options from MEL interface as they are obsolete and
    should be replaced by a new set of raytrace options as e.g. in MtoR
- Fixed 3Delight settings in liqDelightRenderer.cpp (almost all where wrong)
- Aghiles Kheffache: VC++ project settings to compile Liquid with 3Delight


1.5.5:

- Polygon mesh export overhaul for efficiency and facevarying UVs on subdivs
- Crasher bug in Fluid shader editor fixed
- Many other fixes from the last few months


1.5.2:

- Initial release cleaned up with some minor fixes.


1.0:

- Initial release of the source code for the Liquid Rendering Toolkit
